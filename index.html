                <h2>Hi, I'm Alyson. Nice to meet you.</h2>
                <p> I recently started my web development journey by enrolling in a coding boot camp. This is a
                    completely new
                    experience for me, but I'm very excited to see where this might lead!</p>
                <p>So far, I am very much enjoying learning a whole new career, with new languages and systems. I am
                    hoping to find a path for my future self that shares a passion for my work as well as the autonomy
                    to pursue hobbies and spend time with my friends and family outside of my career.</p>
                <p>So, as I walk through this journey, please feel free to <a href="contact.html">reach out</a> to me to
                    ask questions, ask for
                    help, or just chat! I can't wait to meet people in this new programming world and soak up as much
                    knowledge and skills as possible.</p>

                <h2>My past experience.</h2>
                <p>For almost a decade, I have been an Event Planner in a variety of different industries. It has always
                    been my goal to create the most memorable experience for my clients and everyone in attendance.
                    There's nothing better than a sea of smiling faces when an event goes as planned.</p>
                <p>For the last 2 years, I have been an event planner for Posh Petals Floral. This means I get to work
                    with couples on one of their most important days: their wedding day! It's an honor to orchestrate
                    the perfect day for them, so they are able to relax and enjoy the moments, their families, and their
                    friends. </p>
                <p>Prior to that, I worked for iHeartMedia as an Events and Promotions Director for 5 years. This is
                    where I really got my bearings as an event planner. I had the opportunity to plan everything from
                    large scale outdoor festivals, to smaller and more intimate events. Not only did I learn a lot in
                    those 5 years, but I also created many life-long friendships that I cherish to this day.</p>

                <h2>This is Frank.</h2>
                <p>Outside of work, I spend most of my time relaxing with my gentle giant, Frank. To see more (adorable)
                    photos,

                <p>When I'm not taking naps with Frank, I enjoy spending time with my 6 nieces and nephews (how are they
                    so big already!), my supportive family, and my amazing friends. These days it seems that I spend more
                    time with my significant man, Lauren, working on our house that we bought 3 years ago. There's always
                    something new to fix, paint, or update!</p>
